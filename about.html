  <p id = "paragraphDecocration" >
    First of all, let's start with my education. 
    I am an undergraduate student who majors in Computer Science at The City College of New York with good 
    knowledge of data structure and algorithms skills.  I have fundamental knowledge of 
    web development and Software Engineering. Currently, I am also taking a class which teaches me the 
    fundamentals of android developments.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  I am an optimistic person,and I like to accept any kind of challenges. 
  I joined a Wrestling team during my high school years because I heard people said Wrestling is very challenging. 
  While I was on the team, I learned the mindset of never giving up regardless of any situation. 
  Everything can be solved just by simply not giving up and working hard.  In my personal time, 
  I love to watch movies and listen to music. Sometimes I like to watch some algorithms videos on Youtube.
